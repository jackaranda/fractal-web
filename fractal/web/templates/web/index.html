<h1>Future Resilience for African Cities and Lands (FRACTAL)</h1>
<div class="col-md-8">
<div>FRACTAL is one of the Future Climate For Africa (FCFA) regional  consortia that are currently being launched. Led by the Climate System  Analysis Group (CSAG) at the University of Cape Town, the FRACTAL  project is focussed specifically on climate risks and decision making in  cities within their regional dependencies.</div><div><br></div><div>The projectâ€™s overarching aim is to advance scientific knowledge  about regional climate responses to anthropogenic forcings, and to  enhance the integration of this knowledge into decision making at the  co-dependent city-region scale that responsibly contributes to resilient  development pathways. This is addressed through an iterative,  transdisciplinary co-exploration / co-production approach, worked  through a set of deep-focus case studies.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-size: 18px;">Where will FRACTAL work?</span></b></div><div>FRACTAL will work in three Tier 1 cities, namely: Windhoek, Lusaka,  Maputo, and two self funded cities, namely Durban and Cape Town. FRACTAL  will also engage with three Tier 2 cities, namely: Blantyre, Gabarone,  and Harare.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span style="font-size: 18px;">Who is involved?</span></b></div><div>The consortium includes the following member organisations:</div><ul><li>Climate System Analysis Group (CSAG), University of Cape Town</li><li>African Climate &amp; Development Initiative (ACDI), University of Cape Town</li><li>African Centre for Cities (ACC), University of Cape Town</li><li>Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre</li><li>Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)</li><li>ICLEI Local Government for Sustainability</li><li>Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) Oxford</li><li>START</li><li>Aurecon</li><li>Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI)</li><li>Met.
